		<h2 class="about">About Hanzon & Sjöberg</h2>
		<p class="about">Hanzon & Sjöberg was founded in 1997 by the two friends Eva Hanzon and Elisabet Sjöberg. They have both worked with interior decoration for a long time and have extensive experience in decorating both in homes but also public environments.  <br class="ServMar"/> Their expertise and their classical style in interior design, color and shape spread initially within the circle of acquaintances, which have since attracted attention throughout Stockholm.  <br class="ServMar"/> The two friends have been living in Marbella for several years back. They have also been attracted to their solid interior style and expertise that helped many Scandinavians to settle in their Spanish homes.
